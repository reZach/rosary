                    Christ, and the faithful witness of his mother, the Virgin Mary.
                    Mary gave St. Dominic the rosary in the same form we know
                    today. Years later, Mary has come back again to ask
                    that we continue to pray the rosary.

                    are used depending on the day that you are praying
                    the rosary.

                <p class="text-left">
                    While praying the rosary, it is customary to say the
                    order of the Mystery as you say the given Mystery.
                    For example, when we reach the bead marked [4], we
                    would say; "The 1st joyful
                    mystery, the annunciation of the Lord to Mary." The
                    next red bead where
                    we say a Mystery, we would say; "The 2nd joyful mystery,
                    the visitation of Mary to Elizabeth" and so on.

                <b>To Saint Dominic (13th century)</b>
                <ul class="text-left">
                    <li>Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the
                        recitation of the rosary, shall receive signal graces.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the
                        rosary.

                    <li>
                        The rosary shall be a powerful armor against hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and
                        defeat heresies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rosary will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant
                        mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities,
                        and will lift them to the desire for eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by
                        this means.

                        mysteries shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he
                        shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just he shall remain in the grace of God, and
                        become worthy of eternal life.

                        the merits of the saints in paradise.
